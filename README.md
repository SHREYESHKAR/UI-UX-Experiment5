# UI-UX-Experiment 5

# NAME : SHREYESHKAR SEKAR
## REGISTER NUMBER : 212224220099

## Aim: To analyze and design two different UX project scenarios by identifying user pain points, defining clear UX problem statements, selecting appropriate research methods, and creating user personas that reflect real user needs and motivations.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Select two distinct UX project scenarios (e.g., a Health & Fitness App and an E-Commerce Website).

Step 2: Identify the main user pain points for each scenario by observing or imagining real user challenges.

Step 3: Write UX Problem Statements using the template: “[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact].”

Step 4: Identify suitable UX Research Methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing) and provide justification for choosing them.

Step 5: Create User Personas for each scenario including:

Demographics (age, occupation, location)

Goals

Behaviors

Pain Points

Motivations

Step 6: Document all findings and present the outcomes as the Output.

Step 7: Conclude with the Result summarizing what was learned.

## SOLUTION :

## 🩺 Project Scenario 1: Health & Fitness Tracking App

### 1. Problem Statements

Health-conscious users need a way to automatically track their fitness activities because manual entry is time-consuming, which results in inconsistent progress tracking.

New users need a way to receive personalized fitness recommendations because generic content does not match their fitness level, which results in low engagement.

### 2. Research Methods

Chosen Methods:

User Interviews: To understand daily fitness habits and motivational triggers.

Usability Testing: To check whether the interface supports easy activity logging and progress viewing.

Justification:
Interviews help uncover emotional and behavioral challenges, while usability testing evaluates whether the design supports these needs efficiently.

### 3. User Personas

#### Persona 1: Priya Sharma

Age: 27

Occupation: Software Engineer

Location: Bengaluru, India

Goals: Maintain fitness despite a busy schedule.

Behaviors: Uses smartwatch; tracks calories occasionally.

Pain Points: Forgets to log data manually.

Motivation: Stay healthy and energetic for work-life balance.

#### Persona 2: Arjun Patel
Age: 34

Occupation: Marketing Manager

Location: Mumbai, India

Goals: Lose weight and reduce stress.

Behaviors: Uses multiple apps but finds them inconsistent.

Pain Points: Lacks personalized workout suggestions.

Motivation: Wants to see measurable results.



## 🛒 Project Scenario 2: E-Commerce Website (Online Grocery Store)


### 1. Problem Statements

Busy customers need a way to find and order daily groceries quickly because cluttered interfaces make navigation difficult, which results in frustration and wasted time.

Returning users need a way to reorder previous items easily because current apps hide past orders, which results in repeated searches and delays.

### 2. Research Methods

Chosen Methods:

Online Surveys: To collect feedback about shopping frequency, product search, and order experience.

A/B Testing: To test simplified layouts against existing ones and measure improvement in task completion time.

Justification:
Surveys reveal what users value most (speed, clarity, personalization), while A/B testing gives measurable insights on which design performs better in real usage.


### 3. User Personas


#### Persona 1: Neha Verma

Age: 30

Occupation: Working Professional

Location: Delhi, India

Goals: Buy groceries quickly between meetings.

Behaviors: Uses grocery apps multiple times a week.

Pain Points: Too many pop-ups and banners distract her.

Motivation: Wants a smooth and quick checkout.


#### Persona 2: Rajesh Kumar

Age: 42

Occupation: Shop Owner

Location: Chennai, India

Goals: Reorder regular products for home and business.

Behaviors: Shops online monthly; prefers reorder features.

Pain Points: Hard to find frequently purchased items.

Motivation: Wants convenience and time-saving options.



## Output:

-> Two detailed UX project scenarios were created.


-> Clear UX problem statements were written using the standard format.


-> Appropriate research methods were identified and justified.


-> Four user personas (two for each scenario) were developed based on user needs, behaviors, and motivations.




## Result:

The study successfully identified user needs, pain points, and goals for both the health app and e-commerce website. 
By applying appropriate UX research methods and designing detailed personas, the experiment demonstrated how early 
UX research directly improves usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction in digital product design.
