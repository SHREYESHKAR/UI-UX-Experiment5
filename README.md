# EXPERIMENT 5 : PRESENT TWO DIFFERENT PROJECT SCENARIOS:
## NAME :  SHREYESHKAR SEKAR
## REGISTRATION NUMBER : 212224220099

## AIM :

To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## ALGORITHM:

The UX design algorithm begins by identifying user groups, such as first-time applicants and working professionals, to address diverse needs. User pain points are collected via interviews, surveys, and observations, highlighting issues like confusing forms, document upload errors, and unclear status tracking. Problem statements are created using the template: “[User] needs a way to [goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact].” Appropriate research methods are selected, including interviews, surveys, and usability testing. User personas are developed to guide design. Finally, solutions are designed, tested, and iterated, resulting in simplified forms, clear document instructions, transparent tracking, and actionable recommendations.

## OUTPUT:

### Project Scenario 1: Government Service Portal (Online Citizen Services)


### 1. Problem Statements
### User Pain Points:
Citizens face difficulty in finding the correct government forms or applying for services online.

are not mobile-friendly, which results in frustration and reliance on others for help.”
